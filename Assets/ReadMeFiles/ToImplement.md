I think would be kind of cool idea have the Grimoire and we select like from a index for Attack Item Summon Flee, and it like flips the page and shows the attacks for the monsters whos turn it is, or the one we want to summon or item etc and when we flee from a battle we select the page and its like a spell that gets read out that will throw smoke over the battleground and we are out of the battle.
